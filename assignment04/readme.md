# Assignment 4

*by Andreas Peintner, Josef Gugglberger and Lukas DÃ¶tlinger*

## Exercise 1

A 3D heat stencil was implemented using the following domain decompositions: slabs, poles and cubes.

For the *slabs-* and *poles-* implementation please refer to the equally named subdirectories. The *cubes-* implementation is located at `../assignment03/heat_stencil_3D_mpi.cpp`.

For performance, head to the measurements section.

## Exercise 2

Blocking variants of the programs can be found in the equally named subdirectories.
For performance, head to the measurements section.
