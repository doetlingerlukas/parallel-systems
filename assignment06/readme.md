# Assignment 6

*by Andreas Peintner, Josef Gugglberger and Lukas DÃ¶tlinger*

## Exercise 1

### Tasks

- Provide an implementation of your parallelization and optimization plan for the n-body simulation of Assignment 5.
- Measure the speedup and efficiency for multiple problem and machine sizes as in previous exercises.
- Illustrate the data in appropriate figures and discuss them. What can you observe?

### Implementation

For assignment05, we came up with 2 different approaches for parallelization, splitting the area or splitting the problem size.

We tried to split the computation area, which ended up in a *communication-overhead-mess*. Therefore we devided the problem size among the ranks.

We have four (working) implementations:
- `nbody_seq`, a sequential version
- `nbody_seq_opt`, a sequential optimized version
- `nbody_mpi_1`, an unoptimized mpi version
- `nbody_mpi_1_opt`, the optimized mpi version

### Measurements 

All tests were done on `lcc2` with 1000 timesteps.
