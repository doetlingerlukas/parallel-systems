## Exercise 1

### How to submit jobs, check status and delete jobs

* `qsub <script_file>`: submit a job to SGE
* `qstat`: check current state of a submitted job
* `qdel <job_id>`: delete submitted job from queue 

### Submission script

```
#!/bin/bash

#Excecute job in the queue "std.q" unless you have special requirements.
#$ -q std.q

# The batch system should use the current directory as working directory.
#$ -cwd

# Name your job. Unless you use the -o and -e options, output will
# go to a unique file name.ojob_id for each job.
#$ -N my_test_job

# Redirect output stream to this file.
#$ -o output.dat

# Join the error stream to the output stream.
#$ -j yes

# 2 slots per node, 8 slots in total
#$ -pe openmpi-2perhost 8

# load module
module load openmpi/4.0.1

# start script
mpiexec -n 8 /bin/hostname
```

### 5 most important qsub parameters

1. `-help` qsub help screen
2. `-q` queue: submit job to specefic queue
3. `-pe` parallel environment: set up parallel environment
4. `-o` to specify the output file
5. `-cwd` to execute job in current working directory (defaults to `$HOME`)

### How to run a MPI program in parallel

The line `#$ -pe openmpi-2perhost 8` in the job script sets up the parallel environment. The line as it is means: set up 8 nodes with each node having 2 CPU/core slots. To actually start your program in parallel, the job script needs to be executed with the command `mpiexec -n 8 <script_file>`. Again the `-n` flag is set to 8 to execute the program on 8 nodes.
