# Assignment 7

*by Andreas Peintner, Josef Gugglberger and Lukas DÃ¶tlinger*

## Exercise 1

### Tasks

- Study the OpenMP `parallel` and `for` pragmas and attempt to parallelize the n-body simulation using OpenMP. If you have multiple sequential implementations of n-body, you are free to choose one. Also, study how to submit OpenMP jobs on LCC2.
- Measure the execution time of your OpenMP program for several problem sizes and for 1 to 8 threads.
- Illustrate the data in appropriate speedup/efficiency figures and discuss them. What can you observe?

### Implementation

To parallelize our n-body application we add the statement `#pragma omp parallel for private(j)` (line 43) to our n-body implementation of assignment 6. While the ***explicitly*** written down line seems to be very simple, ***impliclitly*** there is going on much here. At first the directive `pragma omp parallel for` is some syntactic sugar, which opens a `parallel` region that contains a single `for` directive (so you save one line + curly brackets for the parallel region). The iteration variable of the inner loop, `j`, is declared private, meaning that each thread has a local copy of that variable. The iteration variable of the outer loop, `i`, is private per default (defined by the `for` directive). Variables declared outside the scope of the parallel region are shared per default in the parallel region. 

### Instructions

Our parallelized application of the n-body problem can be executed on LCC2 with the following line:

```
qsub -sync yes -pe openmp T job.sh -n T -p 'nbody2d_omp N [--verbose]'
```

where `T` represents the number of threads that should be assigned to the job, and `N` represents how many particles should be generated. If `---verbose` is specified, the particles are printed at every timestep.

### Measurements 

All tests were done on `lcc2` with 1000 timesteps.
