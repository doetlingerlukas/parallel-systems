# Assignment 7

*by Andreas Peintner, Josef Gugglberger and Lukas DÃ¶tlinger*

## Exercise 1

### Tasks

- Study the OpenMP `parallel` and `for` pragmas and attempt to parallelize the n-body simulation using OpenMP. If you have multiple sequential implementations of n-body, you are free to choose one. Also, study how to submit OpenMP jobs on LCC2.
- Measure the execution time of your OpenMP program for several problem sizes and for 1 to 8 threads.
- Illustrate the data in appropriate speedup/efficiency figures and discuss them. What can you observe?

### Implementation

- ...

### Instructions

- start with ```qsub -sync yes -pe openmp 2 job.sh -n 2 -p 'nbody2d_omp 10000```

### Measurements 

All tests were done on `lcc2` with 1000 timesteps.
